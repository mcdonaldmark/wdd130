        <p class="indent">My name is Mark McDonald and I am from Longview, Texas. I enjoy spending time with family and friends.
            I currently work for Paychex as a full-time Senior Benefits Advisor for the Western Region of the United States. 
            My region spans from New Mexico to Montana and all the way west which include Hawaii and Alaska. 
            I have been with the company for almost 8 years.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p class="indent">My wife is Miriam McDonald and she is from Ecuador. We have been married for a little over 11 years. One of our favorite things
                to do is travel to places we have never been to. Our most recent vacation took us to Chicago, Illinois which has become our
                favorite major city in the United States.</p>

        <h2>Utah</h2>
        <img src="images/arch.jpg" alt="Utah">
        <p>Utah is home of the famous rivalry between Brigham Young University and the University of Utah. 
            The rivalry is intense and as such, has been dubbed as "The Holy War".
            As two of the biggest colleges in Utah, the football matchup between the 
            two schools are met with a large population of fans who want nothing better 
            than their respective teams to win.</p>
