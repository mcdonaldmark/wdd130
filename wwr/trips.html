            <p class="paragraph2">Enjoy an opportunity to take part in witnessing the salmon run that occurs between the end of summer toward the end of winter. It is an annual, natural phenomenon where adult salmon migrate from the ocean back to the freshwater rivers where they were born to spawn, swimming against the current and often leaping over obstacles to reach their spawning grounds, completing their life cycle by laying eggs before eventually dying. This journey is considered one of nature's most remarkable migrations with different salmon species having distinct "runs" depending on the time of year they migrate upstream to spawn.</p></div>
